1. Epic Meaning
	- Epic Meaning & Calling is the Core Drive where a player believes that he is doing something greater than himself or he was “chosen” to do something.
	- Big motivation for us as a developer is that eventually it is going to help first year students in learning their course with fun.
	- We are going to write a paper from the feedback we got from students and improve according to that. So student will understand  that they have a bigger job that just playing the game for their grades.
2. Development & Accomplishment
	1. Status
		- We will show them how far they have gone into the level and how much time they have, to complete the level.
	2. Badges
		- Badges of they will be able to complete some specific task.
		- 
	3. Rewards
		- We all know that to just get some extra rewards we watch some 30 seconds or long ads in some mobile or online games.
		- In our game players are going to get scores based on amount of money and time left.
		- Some players will get extra point for extra ordinary performance.
			- Ex: If player makes a perfect circuit according to given question he/she will be awarded with a badge let say "Perfect Circuit" and there will a complete log of all his/her achievement and it will be shown on their player profile or on player card.
	4. Leader board
		- There will be a leader board with different types of filtering like money left, time left, xp etc.
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
	- When students feel their voice matters, they want to be included. we will add this through our feedback system.
	- We will improve our game according to their feedback and will contribute towards better experience for their selves 
	- Can implement a visualization elements in Falstad so that it helps the player in improving his design of circuit. We think of visualization elements to be like a game bar showing various how various properties are varying during simulation so that it could help him with insights to come up with new circuit designs. For example the player wishes to make a shunt regulator, we can provide him with a visualization of current passing through the zener during the simulation and based on his previous knowledge of what is the maximum current that must pass through zener , he can change the circuit by perhaps adding a few resistors so as to avoid the dielectric breakdown of zener. We are also adding various visual feedback in TinkerLab in response to various events he would be performing such as soldering , current exceeding maximum limit ,etc for making the game more immersive. We could add interactions with the shopkeeper regarding the materials and the shopkeeper could give him advice for future (like a tool tip).
4. Ownership & Possession 
	- Players are generally motivated to own something and want to protect something.
	- In the classroom, this drive is seen when students are empowered to take control of their education. This can be done by giving students choices over what kinds of assignments they complete, having them contribute test questions, or allowing them to grade themselves.
	- As for the avatar part we want to add system to create their own unique avatars.
