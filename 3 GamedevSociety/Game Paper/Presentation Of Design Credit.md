# Presentation   

Good morning everyone. My name is Kshitij and I am a pre-final year student, currently pursuing my bachelors in mechanical engineering from IIT Jodhpur. Today I’m here to present before you, the work carried out by me as a core team member of the Roll cage and CAE team in the mBAJA competition 2021.

Project Timeline

Tools
1. Unity
2. Postgress Database
3. 

To make the game we done research about possible ways and tools to make the game. First we found [falstad](http://falstad.com/circuit/) as a circuit simulator and unity as a game engine as some of the team members were familiar with unity. We tried embedding falstad into Unity but it didn’t worked out so we created it by our selves.
