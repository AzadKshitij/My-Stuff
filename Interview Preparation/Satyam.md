## Questions

1. React
	React is a JavaScriptÂ **library**, not a framework.

2. Authentication : telling the system who you are by providing username and password. 
3. Authorization : things you can do according to who you are
4. Difficulties : Frontend and backend works on their own but these is a communication issue between them because we hosted our server on AWS and its a HTTP server and our frontend had HTTPS and browser blocks insecure requests. So our deployment is not properly working.

Node:: is a JavaScript runtime. Is designed to execute JavaScript on server. 

Random:: Used `math.random()` to generate random numbers. There is 33.333% chance of cell being a wall. 

**Asynchronous programming** refers code that doesn't execute in sequence. These functions are performed not according to the sequence they are defined inside a program but only when certain conditions are met. 

```js
setTimeOut(function(){
    return( console.log("Hello World!") )
}, 3000)
```
