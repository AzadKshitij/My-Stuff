The term ANN is derived from Biological Neural Network that develops the structure of brain.

ANN is defined by Topology, Weight Vectors, Activation function.

ANNs are composed of three layers 
1. Input Layers
	1. Which receive the Signal from outside world
2. Hidden Layers (Can be of any amount)
	1. Processes the Input Data (With Weight )
3. Output Layers
