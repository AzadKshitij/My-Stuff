It also stores the decaying average of the past gradients, B of T, similar to the realms prop algorithm. What it does essentially is it combines the advantages of both the benchmarks, that is, gradient decent with momentum, as well as the current is prop algorithm that we just found. Now, if you want to find the derivative of the cost with respect to gain, is essentially the first moment calculation. Gradient decent with momentum. Which is B of T equal to beta two times B of T - 1? Plus, 1 minus Beta 2 multiplied by the square of the derivative of the cost function with respect to the gate values that we have. This is a moment that is calculated this is carried out. Next we adjust the learning rate bases ratio of numerator by denominator that is given in this formula.
