# Software Engineering for Machine learning
The latest trend in the software industry is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities based on advances in machine learning. Broadly speaking, artificial intelligence includes technologies for reasoning, problem solving, planning, and learning, among others. Companies use machine learning to create software tools such as virtual assistant, translator for real-time translations.  
  
Artificial intelligence is influencing the way clients connect with businesses through bots. These tools are used daily in our lives and daily work. It is used in industries ranging from retail to healthcare. Artificial intelligence refers to computers that are modified to mimic human insights and do things by thinking like a human brain, how a human brain will react and see it.  
  
Building an AI system is the careful process of reverse-engineering human traits and abilities into a machine and using its computing power to surpass what we are capable of.  
  
Experts have predicted that networked artificial intelligence will enhance human efficiency, but also threaten human autonomy, agency, and capabilities. They spoke of wide possibilities; that computers can match or even exceed human intelligence and abilities in tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They said "smart" systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer individuals opportunities to enjoy a more customized future.  
  
ML is the process of analyzing data and creating an automated model. ML works as an internal part of AI where the system understands human decision making, its patterns, predicts thinking like human brain without the help of any programmers. ML teaches a machine how to make inferences and decisions based on past experiences. It identifies patterns and analyzes past data to infer the meaning of those data points and arrive at a possible conclusion without involving human experience. This automation to reach conclusions by evaluating data saves companies human time and helps them make better decisions.
