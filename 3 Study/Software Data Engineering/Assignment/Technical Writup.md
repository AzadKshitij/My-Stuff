# Software Engineering for Machine learning

## Introductions

The latest trend in the software industry is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities based on advances in machine learning. Artificial intelligence includes technologies for reasoning, problem solving, planning, and learning, among others. Companies use machine learning to create software tools such as virtual assistant, translator for real-time translations.

Artificial intelligence is influencing the way clients connect with businesses through bots. These tools are used daily in our lives and daily work. It is used in industries ranging from retail to healthcare. Artificial intelligence refers to computers that are modified to mimic human insights and do things by thinking like a human brain, how a human brain will react and see it. Building an AI system is a very hard process of reverse-engineering human traits and abilities into a machine and using its computational prowess to surpass what we are capable of doing. There is a limit of what we can do with computers, we need to optimize our system for the particular problem we are trying to solve. We need to design tools that can make process easy and convenient to be used in day to day life. 

## Machine Learning
  
**ML is the process of analyzing data and creating an automated model.** ML works as an internal part of AI where the system understands human decision making, its patterns, predicts thinking like human brain without the help of any programmers. ML teaches a machine how to make inferences and decisions based on past experiences. It identifies patterns and analyzes past data to infer the meaning of those data points and arrive at a possible conclusion without involving human experience. This automation to reach conclusions by evaluating data saves companies human time and helps them make better decisions. Artificial intelligence with ML techniques solves complex data integration problems. For example, conventional methods cannot process huge volumes of data collected from various sources such as streaming and the Internet of Things. In such scenarios, AI/ML techniques not only solve data processing but also improve the integration flow.  
  
Optimizing the data integration platform by plugging artificial intelligence into it improves execution performance by simplifying the development lifecycle, reducing technology learning time, and reducing reliance on high skill requirements to create ETL workflows. Another significant advantage is that ML can train a dataset to be suitable for configuring statistical modeling on it without any manual intervention, thereby mitigating human-induced problems.
  
Data integration complemented by artificial intelligence gradually automates the flow of applications across the organization and the creation of a data pipeline. With the advent of big data storage (HDFS/Hive/Cloud storage), data integration tools access a large volume of heterogeneous data, allowing its integrated recommendation engine to intuitively derive data structure components from it and use the same to automate repetitive data. and redundant data integration tasks. AI is gradually evolving its inference and tagging analytics logic, metadata discovery framework, and acquired knowledge base to meet the growing demand for DI pipelines. 

## Why Software engineering is important for ML?

As mentioned in section of [[3 Study/Software Data Engineering/Assignment/Technical Writup#Machine Learning|ML]] there are many aspect of machine learning and AI. For making the process of creating ML models we need defined software architecture. There are different ways of creating a ML model and they all follow somewhat different path. As human being we choose ease of use over performance when performance is not the priority. There are better performing and fast programming language like [C++](https://cplusplus.com/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) etc. but are not intuitive to use that's why software engineers designed tools in higher level, slow but easy to use programming language like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) etc.

TensorFlow being one of the most powerful and very much used in industries. PyTorch and ScikitLearn are more of easy to use and beginner friendly. These libraries and tools are created by software engineers across the world. Here are some architecture of tools (mentioned above):

### PyTorch [(link)](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/desosa2019/chapters/pytorch/)

These are the tools to create ML models but to make this a reality engineers uses concept of software architecture, software design etc. Without these streams and structure ML wouldn't be that easy.
