# What is RDBMS
	The simplest distinction among relational databases and easy databases is that we will effortlessly create relationships with different tables the use of RDB. Most databases used in recent times are relational databases. 
	
	We can carry out any kind of operation on RDB, consisting of updating, deleting, viewing, and so on. Most relational databases use SQL as a language to get right of entry to the database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language this is used to talk with databases. It enables us create, update, or delete statistics in relational databases. The syntax of SQL is likewise very easy, making it clean to learn. 
	
	Let’s make RDB clean with the assist of a easy example. Let's expect we've got tables; one is a pupil desk wherein we've got pupil call and pupil roll variety, and the opposite desk is an information desk, which has roll variety and overall marks. So, we will make a dating among those tables and discover the whole marks of character students. Note that we've got a not unusualplace column (pupil roll variety) in those tables.

# RDBMS Advantages
1.  **Relational databases are very flexible in nature.** Let's understand this by taking an example. Assume that we have an employee table, and if we need to update any information about an employee, rather than updating it in each file, we simply update it in the main file, and RDBMS automatically updates this information in every file of the database. By doing this, we can save a lot of time.
2.  **Relational databases can be accessed at any time, and they are also very easy to use.** Relational databases allow database admins to control their events, like maintaining data, updating data, etc. Backing up data is also simple with the help of RDBMS and some automation tools.
3.  **The database admin of a relational database has control over the database and can give specific access to the required user.** It cannot give all access to all users. Access is given according to the user’s need.
4.  As we know, **relational databases use rows and columns to store their data, so tables are very comfortable for users to understand.** Also, ***writing queries for RDBMS is easy.***
