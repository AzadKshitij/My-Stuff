## Introduction

Our Project is a blogging solution for communities of different sizes or to manage personal stuff where you can read, create and search for different articles. Our solution is different from existing solutions as it is lightweight and easy to deploy on your own server as it is completely containerized. It doesn't depend on any proprietary software or library so you can customize it as per your need as it is open sources on Github. Frontend is build using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, It has features of Google Login as well as Login with Email and Password. You can write posts with a rich text editor and also upload a Image which will be stores in Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service) bucket to be shown on the feed. Frontend talks to backend with a library **axios**(a Promise-based HTTP client).

Backend is build using Flask(web application framework written in python) and uses **mongoDB** database (a NoSQL general purpose document database). As mentioned previously backend is completely containerized with Docker, flask server runs with waitress(a production-quality pure-Python Web Server Gateway Interface[^1] server) and Nginx(Nginx is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer etc.) for load balance and to serve static files.

Server is built using **Publisher-Subscriber pattern** which enable an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers[^2]. Author will publish the article and all the use on the site will receive the article.
