# Section 3: Financing to address NCDI Poverty 
Domestic health funding is very low in the poorest countries and external donor funding tends to target infectious disease and reproductive, maternal, and child health, leaving little to address the NCDI Poverty burden (appendix pp 100, 101 and figure 13). Overall, nearly 40% of health spending comes out of the pockets of patients themselves, preventing many of the poorest from accessing care and leading to high levels of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) and medical impoverishment.169 Several of the National NCDI Poverty Commissions (Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Nepal) also found evidence that domestic spending on NCDIs involves disproportionately high out-of-pocket spending

available data on domestic financing suggest that the poorest governments are not able to spend enough to address their NCDI burden. Even with optimistic projections of economic growth, taxation, and allocation of government revenues to health, most of the poorest countries will not have sufficient domestic resources to fully address NCDIs by 2030. We endorse the emphasis on increasing domestic financing set by the SDGs.170 Our analysis highlights the importance of development assistance to address NCDI Poverty, however, particularly in low-income countries. Research for this Commission shows that external financing for NCDIs has remained minimal and has not been targeted to the poorest countries. Yet, most donors say equity is important, and that they want to reach marginalised populations. However, at present, they do not associate NCDIs with those goals.

# Domestic financing for NCDIs 
### Government spending on NCDIs
This Commission pursued multiple avenues to determine the amount of domestic government spending for NCDIs of the poorest. The results provide some insight into how much national governments in 55 low-income and lower-middle-income poorest billion countries are spending on NCDIs, but shed less light on what services are being purchased and for whom (appendix pp 100, 101). The best official source for health expenditure data across countries is the WHO National Health Accounts (NHA). WHO’s NHA system follows the International Classification for Health Accounts scheme for health care functions with some small differences.188 Selected NHA information is publicly available through WHO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development websites.189 WHO works collaboratively with member states to collect the underlying data, although little information is available regarding data quality assurance. Figure 14 shows the most recent available information on NCDI spending from low and middle income countries in the NHA database from 2017 (appendix pp 100, 101). Disease-specific health expenditure data is shown for NCDIs from 23 of the 55 poorest billion countries (45% of the poorest population). Most of the poorest countries report low government expenditures on health, with a variable fraction spent on NCDIs. Low-income countries spent between US$0·6 per cap health expenditures. The poorest lower-middle-income countries spent between US$1·8 per capita (Kenya) and US$35 per capita (Bhutan), corresponding to between 3% and 38% of government health expenditures. Injuries accounted for an average of 22% of government NCDI spending in the poorest countries. The Commissioners concluded that reliable information on domestic spending for NCDs must ideally be gathered and verified through a detailed search of budgetary documents within the countries. 
For a deeper understanding of the scale and distribution of domestic NCD funding, the India NCDI Poverty Consortium undertook an examination of local health budget information for India, a country with extremely low domestic spending on NCDs in the context of low government priority for health spending. India spends only 1·1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health, putting it at the low end of countries ranked by public investment in health care. Estimates based on local and central government budgets indicate that slightly more than one-fourth of total health expenditure targets NCDIs, and about four-fifths of this expenditure takes place at the state level. Although the gap between spending and DALYs from NCDIs is greatest in the economically vulnerable states that have the highest concentrations of poorest billion populations, NCDI spending is low almost across the board in India (panel 9). 

# Household spending on NCDIs 
The largest source of payment for NCDI care in many of the poorest countries is direct household expenditure. For example, in Ethiopia, according to the Sixth National Health Accounts, 68% of all NCDI services were financed by out-of-pocket expenditures from households; the government was responsible for approximately 30% of NCDI expenditures; and donors contributed only 2%. 
This reliance on out-of-pocket spending for NCDI services among those who can least afford it is consistent with the long-known fact that the highest rates of out of pocket spending as a proportion of total health spending occur in low-income countries.192 High out-of-pocket costs associated with NCDIs might cause patients to forego life-saving care, or it might result in CHE. 
A systematic review by the Lancet Taskforce on NCDs and Economics identified 66 studies that evaluated the effect of NCDs on household economics in low and middle income countries. These studies included data from 9 of the 55 poorest billion countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, and Tanzania). Based on their analysis of those studies, the Taskforce found that “NCDs can lead to devastating, long-term economic consequences for individuals and their households, particularly in resource poor settings”. More than 60% of some NCD patient populations were found to experience catastrophic spending, especially—but not exclusively—among the uninsured.

Catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment due to NCDI Poverty 
This Commission sought to better understand the effect of out-of-pocket payments related to NCDI specifically for the world’s poorest billion people (panel 10). A modelling study to quantify the magnitude CHE among the poorest billion was done. Corroborating evidence regarding the effect of NCDIs on CHE and household impoverishment from National NCDI Poverty Commissions that had carried out country-level studies was sought. 
Between 27 million and 50 million of the world’s poorest billion people were estimated to spend a catastrophic amount each year in direct costs of health care for NCDIs (defined as more than 40% of their capacity to pay). The poorest experience this high level of CHE (plunging them into deeper poverty) despite the fact that they frequently forgo health care because of the associated costs. The total number of people annually experiencing CHE globally using the 40% threshold was previously estimated to be 208 million. 

The India NCDI Poverty Consortium analysed National Sample Survey data in India to assess the burden and the subsequent effect on poverty of expenditures on outpatient visits and hospitalisations for NCDIs. National Sample Survey data indicate that self-reported NCDIs are substantial among socioeconomically vulnerable groups (eg. rural residents, scheduled castes and tribes, lower income quintiles, and some of the economically vulnerable states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan). The study found that out-of-pocket expenditures on NCDIs were much higher than that for communicable diseases— more than twice as high for hospitalisations and almost 60% higher for outpatient visits—pushing many NCDI patient households into poverty. The headcount of poverty

# Panel 9: A case study of domestic NCDI financing in India
Government spending on non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) in India represents slightly more than a quarter of total government health spending, which itself is low at 1·1% of gross domestic product. The bulk of the spending (80%) takes place in the states, leaving considerably less space for policy manoeuvres at the federal level. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) itself only accounts for about 65% of all federal spending on health, with other ministries together spending the remainder. NCDI spending by the MOHFW increased gradually from 14% of total Ministry health spending in 2014 to 20% in 2019. An analysis of state-level poverty, spending, and disability-adjusted life-years indicates that poor states spend the least on NCDIs and many high burden states are not able to spend commensurate amounts on NCDIs. India does not depend on donor funding for health, and will have to step up domestic funding to address the increasing disease burden of NCDIs and to reduce the high out-of-pocket expenditure. The challenge will be forming and implementing a cogent all-India policy with commensurate funding. Given that responsibility for meeting these financing and operational challenges will fall mainly on the states, the federal government will have to determine whether and how a uniform approach towards control, prevention and treatment of NCDIs can be implemented in the country.


### Panel 10: Voices of NCDI Poverty 
Pabitra Manandhar, chronic kidney disease, 26 years old (Nepal) 
“Life used to be good. I had a very beautiful family. We were four of us. I was pursuing my higher secondary education. I attended my classes regularly, and I also used to work in a finance company. Suddenly my head started to hurt. I was unable to do the regular chores and missed a lot of working days. So I decided to go to the clinic. They told me my blood pressure was too high for someone my age. They prescribed medication and asked me to come back in a week. After a week, they suspected some issues with my kidney and sent me to a bigger hospital. The doctors told me that my condition wasn’t good.” Since Pabitra Manandhar was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in 2010, life has become difficult for her and her family. Pabitra had been the first member of her family to learn to read and start a professional job. But she is no longer able to work, and her family has been forced to sell off their land and go into debt to pay for the dialysis treatment that keeps her alive. “I had to pay 2500 rupees (US$25) for every dialysis. Neither I nor my family had enough money to pay for it. It was a very difficult time. I had no money for dialysis. I felt hopeless. My dad offered to sell the land he owned. We all agreed as my life was more valuable than a piece of land.” Pabitra’s father is also in poor health. Soon after Pabitra fell ill, his eyesight began to fail and construction contractors stopped hiring him as a labourer. More recently he was diagnosed with cancer. Her brother, who had hoped to donate a kidney if they could ever afford transplant surgery, died by suicide. Her mother, who works as a farm labourer, is now the sole breadwinner for the family. “I got my mother tested because she was willing to donate her kidney to me. With the loss of my brother, I saw my mother suffering. Her health was deteriorating as she began losing weight. I decided not to take her kidney, because I cannot afford to lose her. Life will be worthless without her. We are bankrupt. The earthquake destroyed our house and we are living in this makeshift shelter. If only I had a piece of land, I could sell it for the treatment, build a house, and give my parents a good life.”

for people who report NCDIs in rural areas almost doubles, from 20% before NCDI expenditure to 38% after.200 The Ethiopia NCDI Poverty Commission found, based on self-reported data, that NCDIs account for almost a quarter of total out-of-pocket expenditures in Ethiopian households. More than a quarter (27%) of patients with cardiovascular disease in Addis Ababa who sought care experienced CHEs, and this proportion was even higher in low-income households outside the capital.201 A modelling study also showed the potentially high burden of medical impoverishment related to NCDIs in Ethiopia. The study further showed that some NCDI interventions could contribute to efficiently reducing such impoverishment.202,203 Drawing on analyses of data from the Kenya Household Health Expenditure and Utilization Survey of 2007, the Kenya NCDI Poverty Commission reported that out-of pocket expenditures and loss of productivity caused by NCDIs have a profound impoverishing effect on households. NCDs reduce household income by 28·6%, more than double the impoverishing effect of general health conditions (14%).204 Nearly a third (30%) of households affected by NCDs in the lowest quintile experienced CHEs (defined by this study as >30% of total household income). Furthermore, the odds of becoming impoverished due to out-of-pocket expenditures were over 30% higher for households affected by NCDs as compared with households affected by communicable diseases. The Nepal NCDI Poverty Commission used data from the 2010–11 Nepal Living Standards Survey to estimate the disease-specific impoverishing effects of NCDIs.205,206 The Nepal Commission found that every case of cancer, high blood pressure, injuries, and heart, kidney, and liver disease could cause between 0·3 and 1·5 cases of poverty. At the population level, injuries, gastrointestinal diseases, and heart disease had the highest effect on impoverishment due to their prevalence. To reduce the risk of CHEs, essential NCDI services must be financed through pooled resources, either from increased domestic funding or external funds. High out of-pocket expenditures for essential NCDI services create financial stress and are inefficient and inequitable.

### Domestic charitable spending on NCDIs 
Domestic non-governmental sources of funding, such as local charitable organisations and local disease-specific foundations, provide diverse services in the countries where the poorest billion live, but documentation and independent evaluation are rare. Thus, it is not possible to access in a systematic manner the part that charities play in addressing NCDI Poverty, but examples suggest that they provide tertiary services that would otherwise be completely unavailable or unaffordable to poor populations. The Heart file Health Financing programme in Pakistan, for example, has been able to channel individual philanthropic contributions towards patients in need of specialised surgical and medical care for NCDIs. 

### External financing for NCDIs and NCDI Poverty 
We examined trends in external financing for NCDIs in general, and more specifically for the share targeted to the 55 LLMICs where the vast majority of the poorest billion lives (figure 15). Drawing on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, we found that between 1% and 2% of total Development Assistance for Health (DAH) has been targeted to NCDIs since 2001.209 Our analysis also shows that the poorest countries have received a small and shrinking fraction of the limited DAH that goes to NCDIs. In 2011, the year of the first UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs, only US$74 million in external financing for NCDIs was directed to the poorest countries.209 This represented 14% of all global development assistance for NCDIs in 2011. Between 2011 and 2016, even as NCDs were adopted as priorities within the UHC and SDG agendas, the amount of external financing targeted for NCDIs in the poorest countries had increased to just US$83 million This represented only 10% of global development assistance for NCDIs, and approximately 0·3% of the US$24·6 billion in all country-allocable DAH in 2016. To better understand how external financing has addressed the NCDIs of the poorest, we reviewed databases of donor funding for health to extract the amounts, sources, and destinations of NCDI funding from DAH for 2010–14 (appendix pp 103–105). There is little evidence that NCDI donors are targeting the poor in the poorest countries. Of the total DAH for NCDIs in 2014, 70% was not allocated to any specific country. Of the NCDI DAH that was targeted to specific countries in that year, US$68 million (6%) was allocated to one of the poorest 55 countries. 434 NCDI projects were identified in these countries, with a total budget of US$10 million that were explicitly targeting the poor. 

### Projected financing capacity for NCDI Poverty in LLMICs 
Currently, there is a large gap between the cost of implementing the package of EUHC interventions (as defined by the DCP project) and available health financing capacity in the poorest countries (figure 16). Including both government and out-of-pocket expenditures and external financing, the poorest countries (except for a few, such as Rwanda) are not spending enough on health to fully finance the EUHC interventions to address infectious diseases and RMNCH issues. NCDI interventions are an additional opportunity that is currently out of reach for all but a handful. We have made projections until 2030 to understand the potential health financing capacity that could be available to countries as a result of economic growth and renewed domestic commitments even if external financing remains constant. A range of plausible rates of per capita GDP growth during this period were considered.4,211 We linearly scaled the rates of revenue generation from domestic taxation for each country based on estimates of taxation potential from the Overseas Development Institute.210 Additionally, we scaled the proportion of government expenditure devoted to health up to 15% for all countries.212 We found that, on average, both low-income and the poorest lower-middle-income countries have an opportunity to finance the US$32 to US$36 per capita estimated cost of essential interventions for infectious disease and RMNCH from domestic sources by 2030 even if external assistance remains constant.210 Additionally, the poorest lower-middle-income countries might have an opportunity to finance essential NCDI interventions from additional domestic sources by 2030. However, these countries will struggle unless economic growth is strong, they are able to increase taxation, and they allocate a greater fraction of government expenditures to health. Even under highly optimistic scenarios, low-income countries and the poorest lower-middle-income countries will have a large gap in health financing capacity for NCDIs without additional development assistance. 

# Section 4: Global and national policy, governance, and agenda-setting for NCDI Poverty 
In previous sections of this report, evidence about the importance of a diverse collection of NCDIs among the world’s poorest billion people (NCDI Poverty) has been presented. Much of this burden has been shown to be among children and young adults and is avoidable through cost-effective interventions both within and outside the health sector. Additionally, the cost of these interventions collectively exceeds available resources in the countries where the poorest billion live. Without global solidarity, there will continue to be much unnecessary death, suffering, and impoverishment. This Commission may lead to a greater insight into the nature of NCDI Poverty. However, the Commission will only be successful if it convinces global actors and national governments to contribute to the health of the poorest on a greater scale, consistent with country priorities. Theories of political priority for movements in global health have focused on the importance of ideas and issue characteristics in addition to the strength of actors and the political

contexts in which they operate. In this section of our report, we seek to understand how NCDI Poverty has been addressed in global and national health and development policies, plans, targets and frameworks. We also seek to explore how issue framing might have contributed to the neglect of NCDI Poverty in global and national health and development agendas and resourcing. The UN system has been singularly important for global NCDI policy and governance. In 2017, WHO alone commanded 20% (US$164 million) of all NCDI development financing globally, more than any other single entity.169 The World Bank had the second largest share (US$93·7 million in 2017), but most (78%) of this financing is provided at nearly commercial terms. In the context of otherwise extremely low amounts of development assistance for NCDIs (as discussed in section 3), WHO’s resources enable it to play crucial normative, standard-setting, and convening functions. The dialogues, consultations, conventions, regulations, guidelines, and recommendations for public health policy that WHO produces–which are adopted and adapted by its 194 member states–are the means through which it fulfils its technical leadership role in health. We have reviewed the history of NCDIs within WHO and the World Bank have been reviewed using archival documents and interviews. To track the evolution of NCDI framing and policies at WHO, we examined approximately 500 documents from the WHO archives, as well as more than 450 published WHO documents, including official histories and technical report series. We conducted semi-structured interviews with four living former directors of the NCD units at WHO. Policy documents and assessments of the World Bank’s engagement with global health over the same period were reviewed. The influence of NCDI framing at these two entities within the UN system on the discourse of other global actors were analysed through document reviews and key informant interviews (appendix pp 109–115). The influence of global NCDI frameworks on national policy in countries where the poorest billion live was evaluated. We find that, over the past 40 years, NCDI efforts in the UN system have been on a parallel track, separate and disconnected from the agenda to address the health of the poorest billion (figure 17). The agenda for the poorest billion, embodied by the MDGs, has been largely concerned with priority infectious diseases, maternal, and child health. Meanwhile, an agenda for NCD prevention and control was developed in WHO’s European regional office in the late 1970s, and was later applied in low and middle income countries, based on a shared, common risk factor framework and consistent with increasingly popular theories of epidemiological transition. These NCD frameworks grew out of efforts to control cardiovascular disease and stroke in high-income countries, and increasingly replaced the broader understandings of NCDIs prevalent at WHO headquarters in earlier decades. This approach to NCDs was crystallised during the first UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs in 2011 in the 4×4 (four diseases and four risk factors) concept and its associated monitoring framework and best buys. In the SDG era, this legacy NCD framework continues to shape how NCDIs are understood by global multilaterals, development agencies, and philanthropists. At the same time, institutions designed to support the MDG agenda (such as the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis, and Malaria) continue to channel the flow of most DAH. We found some modest indications from key informant interviews that reframing NCDI Poverty in terms of a broader range of severe conditions affecting children and young adults might shift the global financing landscape (appendix pp 104, 105). We find that NCDI Poverty Commissions are prioritising a broader range of interventions addressing a larger set of conditions than those identified among the global best buys. These interventions include treatment to manage (and in some cases cure) existing NCDIs using platforms at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the health system. Our analysis suggests that the SDG era has sustained a compromise wherein development assistance continues to provide catalytic funding for the MDG agenda for the poorest (although inadequately), while even low-income countries are expected to finance NCDI prevention from domestic resources. At the moment, external financing to treat NCDIs among the poorest children and young adults isn’t even on the table. In part, global actors can claim that they are responding to country priorities.32,195–197 At the same time, the countries in which the poorest billion live have not had the resources to define their NCDI priorities based on country-level data and ethical principles. As a result, there has been a vicious cycle in which neither national planning nor global strategies are fully addressing NCDI Poverty. 

## The NCDI Poverty gap at global institutions 
On the eve of the UN SDG summit, a group of prominent health economists suggested that NCDIs should not yet be considered a priority for a “pro-poor pathway to UHC as an essential pillar of development”.215,216 Writing in The Lancet, the economists declared that, “Our generation has a historic opportunity to achieve a grand convergence in global health, reducing preventable maternal, child, and infectious disease deaths to universally low levels by 2035”; reductions in preventable NCDI deaths were notably absent from the envisioned grand convergence. The tracks for the poorest billion and the NCDI agenda appeared to be distinct and parallel going into the SDG era. The 2011 UN High Level Meeting had assured that NCDs would be included in early 21st century global health priorities. But by importing 20th century chronic disease frameworks, the meeting also reinforced a prevailing NCDI Poverty gap.

This Commission has worked to understand how the NCDI framing that developed within the UN system over the past 40 years has influenced the prioritisation and agendas of global institutions during the SDG era. We focused on those institutions that have an out-sized role in DAH as a proxy for their influence regarding policies

for health, poverty reduction, and economic development. Institutions reviewed in our analysis included: multilateral health and development organisations, bilateral funders, and corporate and family foundations (appendix pp 110–116). In total, we examined 35 entities, and extracted textual mentions of NCDIs and risk factors, as well as text that discussed health equity, prioritisation of poor populations, and financial and social risk protection (figure 18). To the extent that they have addressed NCDs at all, we found that all of the global multilaterals and bilateral institutions, without exception, have adopted the 4×4 framing and the emphasis on health promotion and prevention of WHO’s Global NCD Action Plan as the foundation of their approach to NCDIs. Although most of these institutions focus on poverty reduction as a priority, none of them identify NCDIs as either a cause or a consequence of extreme poverty to be addressed as a priority within the poverty eradication agenda. Regional institutions located in parts of the world with large concentrations of people living in extreme poverty have built and expanded on the 4×4 foundation to address other conditions and risk factors that disproportionately affect the poor. WHO regional offices in Africa and South East Asia, for example, discuss the four main diseases and risk factors with a focus on preventive health services, but also address other conditions and risk factors that are important in their regions. The Brazzaville Declaration, adopted by the WHO African Regional Office in advance of the 2011 UN High Level Meeting, emphasised the importance of “haemoglobinopathies (in particular sickle cell disease), mental disorders, violence and injuries, oral and eye diseases in the WHO African Region”.32 Similarly, the WHO South East Asia Regional Office noted that “in addition to the four main NCDs, many other chronic conditions and diseases contribute significantly to the NCD burden in the Region” and highlighted the importance of infectious and environmental risks such as indoor air pollution.96 Most of the corporate and family foundations that are influential in global health and development do not address NCDIs broadly as a category in their strategies and policies. With one notable exception, the large corporate or family foundations that do fund NCD programmes typically target specific conditions or risk factors, such as mental health, injuries, vision disorders, tobacco control, or road safety, without mentioning NCDIs as a group. The exception is Bloomberg Philanthropies. In its 2018 annual report, Bloomberg Philanthropies introduces its health programme by stating, “The Public Health program combats noncommunicable diseases and injuries by spreading solutions that are proven to save lives”.217 The Bloomberg Philanthropies public health programme strategy aligns closely with the 4×4 framing and health promotion and prevention best buys of the Global Action Plan. The strategy features programmes to control tobacco use, prevent obesity, and improve road safety, as well as a leading role in the Resolve to Save Lives initiative to combat cardiovascular disease through treatment of high blood pressure and promotion of healthy diets.218 Our analysis suggests that even global institutions with a focus on extreme poverty have tended to adopt an approach to NCD framing (4×4) that was historically developed by and for high-income regions. The lack of global resource mobilization for NCDI Poverty might be due, in part, to the way the full scope of this issue has been made invisible in current framing of the NCD agenda and its propagation through development and philanthropic institutions. 

### NCDIs in national planning in the poorest countries 
As we had done with the global institutions, we sought to understand whether and how NCDI framing within the UN system has shaped health sector and poverty reduction planning in the countries where the poorest billion live. Since 2003, four high-level forums on aid effectiveness have emphasised the importance of alignment of development assistance around country owned priorities.195–197,219 National strategic planning should be guiding international cooperation and aid on NCDIs. Instead, our analysis suggests that the opposite is happening in practice: international frameworks are being replicated in the poorest countries even when these frameworks were not developed in response to local disease patterns and concerns. Additionally, at a national level, NCDI planning and anti-poverty strategy continue on the parallel tracks laid globally: NCDI Poverty in not being addressed in poverty eradication and sustainable development plans. Both National NCD Strategic Plans (NCDSPs) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) were examined from LLMICs with at least one major subnational region with more than a 25% prevalence of extreme poverty by multidimensional measures. NCDSPs are the country-owned planning documents that set out national priorities and resource needs for NCDI control–typically for a 5-year period–consistent with broader health-sector strategic plans.220 Countries committed to developing NCDSPs during the first UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs in 2011, and again during the second High-Level Meeting on NCDs in 2014. 221 In advance of the third UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs in 2018, the Secretary General reported that 48% of UN member states had developed these plans.222 PRSPs are country-owned planning documents that identify operational strategies and resource requirements for poverty reduction. Between 1999 and 2015, PRSPs were prepared by the poorest countries every 3 years to qualify for concessional lending from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.223,224 PRSPs have since been replaced by sector-specific lending frameworks, but remain a valuable record of how health-sector interventions have been positioned as part of poverty eradication.

We were able to identify the most recent publicly available NCDSPs from 27 of the poorest LLMICs that collectively were home to 47% of the world’s poorest billion population (appendix pp 117–124). We also identified publicly available PRSPs prepared by 29 of these countries since 2000 (appendix pp 125–127). We analysed what NCDI conditions, risk factors, and interventions were discussed in these documents. What we found suggests that health sector policymakers in most countries recognise the importance of conditions and risk factors not targeted in GMFs. However, these countries have also largely adopted the

voluntary targets and best buys of the 2013 Global NCD Action Plan (GAP) and GMF as the foundation of their NCD strategies.8,95 Adherence to the 4×4 framework, GAP targets, and best buys was all but universal in the PRSPs. 

### An expanded NCDI situation with a 4×4 monitoring framework in national NCD planning
Our review of NCDSPs suggests that most countries’ national NCD strategies have been strongly influenced by and oriented toward the NCD agenda advanced in WHO’s Global NCD Action Plans and adopted in the SDGs. Most of the plans explicitly reference the 2011 High-Level Meeting on NCDs and WHO’s 2013 GAP and GMF.8,95 With a single exception, all of them discuss all four of the main disease categories that are included in the 4 × 4 framework and highlighted in the mortality reduction targets of the GPA and the SDGs. More than half discuss specific conditions within each of the categories, but only one other NCD condition–sickle cell disease–is mentioned by as many as half of the countries. Adherence to the framing and targets of global monitoring frameworks is even more pronounced in the NCD risk factors that are discussed in these NCD Strategic Plans. More than 80% of the plans reviewed explicitly discuss all four of the behavioural risk factors that define the 4 × 4 framework and are featured in the GMF’s nine voluntary targets. The only other risk factors mentioned in more than half the plans are the four metabolic risk factors that are also included in the GMF’s nine voluntary targets and 25 indicators. Most of the NCDSPs do recognise other conditions and risk factors that are important to the NCDI burden of their populations. More than three-quarters discuss injuries, and two-thirds include mental health and substance use disorders, anticipating the expanded 5 × 5 definition of NCDs adopted at the UN High-Level Meeting in 2018·10 Most of the plans reviewed also address other NCDs that do not fall within the four main disease categories. More than 40% of these poorest billion countries discuss sickle cell disease and epilepsy. In addition, many of the specific conditions within the four main disease categories that are mentioned are not associated with the shared behavioural risk factors of the 4 × 4 model, including cervical cancer, rheumatic heart disease, and asthma, all of which are mentioned in more than 40% of the plans. Notably, these same conditions were also highlighted by our analysis of the severe NCDs that disproportionately affect the poorest billion and were prioritised by national NCDI Poverty Commissions that have completed their analyses. We did a deeper analysis of the 21 NCDSPs that included both situation analyses and frameworks for monitoring implementation and progress (appendix pp 117–124). Conditions and risk factors mentioned in background narratives were compared with those included in implementation monitoring frameworks. Our analysis found that although these countries discuss a broad range of conditions and risk factors in narrative situation analyses of their NCDI burden, the only conditions and risks included in 50% or more of the monitoring frameworks are the four main disease categories, plus six behavioural and metabolic risk factors that are included in the voluntary targets and indicators of WHO’s Global Monitoring Framework.

### Panel 11: The Ethiopia NCDI Poverty Commission 
In August, 2016, Ethiopia established a National NCDI Poverty Commission with 18 members drawn from government, academia, and civil society, and a mandate to build the country’s NCDI evidence base, and to create a forum for applying fair priority-setting principles through an accountable process. The Commission held five additional meetings before publishing its final report in November, 2018.226 The Ethiopia Commission pursued a three-step priority-setting process based on WHO recommendations to consider cost-effectiveness, priority to the worse off (equity), and financial risk protection.115 Step 1 was to identify relevant services and evidence. The Ethiopia Commission began with a list of NCDI services judged to be essential by the Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition (DCP3) project227 and adapted it for the Ethiopian context. Each intervention was graded for cost effectiveness (based on evidence from DCP3 and available country specific estimates), equity (based on estimates of lifetime loss of health due to specific causes), and financial risk protection.228,229 Step 2 was to select the highest priority set of NCDI services. To determine which interventions to include, the Commission first ranked the list based on incremental cost-effectiveness and then adjusted it according to expected impact on equity and financial risk protection. Step 3 was to estimate costs and fiscal space. Costs were estimated using the One Health Tool (version 4.5) with most services scaled by 25% over the period from 2019 to 2023. Considerations of fiscal space suggested that incremental costs for NCDIs could not exceed around US$5 per capita (about 17% of total government health expenditure). By 2022, the incremental cost of the prioritised set of NCDI services would be around US$550 million, corresponding to US$4·7 per capita. The final list of prioritised NCDI services included 90 health-sector interventions, including palliative care, human papillomavirus vaccination, treatment of acute pharyngitis, chronic management of rheumatic fever, depression, those at high cardiovascular risk in the community; general surgery and chronic management of type 1 diabetes, heart failure, and psychosis at first-level hospitals; and surgery for congenital conditions, as well as chemotherapy for selected cancers at referral hospitals

### NCDIs and poverty eradication on separate tracks in national poverty reduction planning 
To understand how NCDIs are being framed as part of poverty eradication in the countries where the poorest billion live, we analysed PRSPs publicly available through the International Monetary Fund. As was the case with the NCDSPs, our analysis strongly suggests that the 2011 UN High-Level Meeting prompted these countries to include some mention of NCDs. This suggests that global political processes can have an effect on national agendas. At the same time, our analysis of the PSRPs suggests that in the SDG era, countries are continuing to view NCDIs as part of a health agenda that is separate and distinct from the health priorities of the poorest and from strategies for poverty eradication. Very few (only 3 of 14) of the PRSPs prepared before 2011 and the UN High-Level Meeting mention NCDs. Almost all (11 of 15) of those published after 2011 do mention NCDs. Those that do include a discussion of NCDs generally used the term generically, often referring to the category as an emerging problem, or specifically mentioned some or all of the four main disease categories and risk factors of the 4×4 framework. Many of the PRSPs included a discussion of mental health disorders. Consistent with the Brazzaville Declaration, several of the African countries also addressed sickle cell disease. Of the 29 PRSPs reviewed, none propose to undertake and monitor interventions specifically to address NCDIs among the poor.

NCDI Poverty Commissions: expanding NCDI frameworks with a focus on the poorest To enable the countries where the poorest billion live to end the neglect of NCDIs, this Commission has supported National NCDI Poverty Commissions in LLMICs with a high prevalence of extreme poverty. As of August, 2020, 16 National NCDI Poverty Commissions have been established in the following countries: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti, India (Chhattisgarh State), Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (appendix pp 128, 129). Ten other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America responded in July, 2020, to a Request for Applications for technical and financial support in establishing new National Commissions. Collectively, these Commissions already represent around half the world’s poorest billion people. We hope that these National Commissions will break the cycle in which neither national planning nor global agendas are fully addressing NCDI Poverty. The composition of these National Commissions has mirrored The Lancet NCDI Poverty Commission, with around 10–20 members and co-chairs typically representing an academic institution and the Ministry of Health. In addition to regular meetings within country to develop and review analyses and recommendations, leadership from these Commissions participated in teleconference Knowledge Exchange meetings, co-hosted by the World Bank.225 The initial work of these National Commissions has been focused on situation analysis and priority setting. Seven of the National Commissions have completed this work, and three have moved on to a second phase, focused on: the strategic dissemination of key findings and recommendations to elevate NCDI Poverty as a priority for national policies and financing; and the design of integrated delivery strategies for prioritised interventions. We hope that these National Commissions will move on to pilot the implementation of these delivery models and ultimately to national scale-up with the support of financial and technical partnerships (figure 19). The goals of the first phase of the National Commissions have also mirrored this Commission: analyse and highlight the national NCDI burden of disease, particularly in relation to poverty; understand the availability and coverage of NCDI services in the health sector; prioritise among conditions and interventions to address the NCDI burden, taking into account, at a minimum, both cost-effectiveness and equity (by giving some priority to the worst off in terms of both material poverty and disease severity); estimate the cost and potential impact of prioritised interventions; and forecast potential fiscal space to afford these interventions. Eight of the National Commissions (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, and Nepal) have already completed some or all this first phase of the Commission process and have published their initial reports. The Ethiopia Commission offers a good example of National Commission development in Africa (panel 11) and the Nepal Commission offers a good example from South Asia (panel 12). These Commissions prioritised a wide range of interventions, spanning prevention, medical management, surgery, and palliative care at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels (panel 13). The National NCDI Poverty Commissions have been focused primarily on interventions that can be delivered through the health sector. Many of these Commissions also recommended health promotion through intersectoral interventions. In this way, the National NCDI Poverty Commissions have offered a complementary agenda to the one identified in the WHO Global Action Plan for NCDs and its best buys, which have been primarily focused on policies to address behavioural risk factors for NCDs 

### Panel 12: The Nepal NCDI Poverty Commission 
Nepal established a National NCDI Poverty Commission in 2016 with a mandate to analyse the state of non-communicable diseases and infections (NCDIs) in Nepal and to recommend a package of cost-effective health sector interventions addressing the NCDI burden, with an emphasis on conditions affecting the poor in Nepal. The Commission convened its first meeting in November, 2016, and completed phase 1 of the National Commission Process—situation analysis and priority setting—over the next 18 months (figure 19). In March, 2018, the Commission published a report presenting its findings and recommendations.230 The Commission found that NCDIs account for nearly two-thirds (65%) of the burden of disease in Nepal and that more than half of the NCDI conditions with the highest burden of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Nepal are not related to the 4×4 risk factors that have been emphasised by global monitoring frameworks and action plans. Their analysis also determined that, with the notable exceptions of diabetes and high blood pressure, the prevalence of many NCD categories was highest among the poorest quintiles of the population. To establish priorities for conditions and interventions, the Commission first ranked all NCDI conditions based on their overall health impact (total DALYs) and prevalence in Nepal. They then evaluated each condition for severity, inequity in outcomes between those who are poor and not poor, and impoverishing impact, to arrive at a list of 25 conditions requiring priority attention. To identify interventions to address this burden, the Commission worked from the Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition package of cost-effective interventions to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) in low-income countries. 23 of these interventions were selected for further evaluation based on their alignment with the disease conditions prioritised by the Commission, feasibility in the Nepali context, cost-effectiveness, financial risk protection, and equity. If these interventions are introduced and incrementally intensified to establish UHC, the Commission estimated that nearly 10000 premature deaths per year could be averted by 2030, with an increase in costs of approximately US$8·76 per capita. In June, 2018, the Commission initiated work on phase 2 of the National Commission Process. The Commission’s key objectives for this second phase include: disseminating the findings in the Commission report, determining the readiness of the Nepal Government to incorporate the recommendations of the report, critically analysing NCDI poverty issues among children and young adults, and developing and piloting models for integrated delivery of prioritised NCDI services.

### Panel 13: Voices of NCDI Poverty 
Estifanos Balcha, type 1 diabetes, 20 years old (Ethiopia) “I have type 1 diabetes, the kind you need insulin for. I used to be a street kid, though my parents are alive. My father is with someone else and my mother is with someone else. And they both see me as a bastard child. From the age of 6 to 13, I lived on the street. Getting food was difficult at times. When my sugar used to drop, I used to steal soda to get it up. While I was taking insulin, I used to sniff glue, smoke hash, hookah, cigarettes. I drank different kinds of alcohol. All this to forget my problems. On top of that, I didn’t have anywhere to put my medicine. So I used the refrigerator in various stores. I didn’t always take my medicine appropriately. I used to mess up the time, and sometimes I just didn’t care.” At the age of 6 years, Estifanos Balcha was forced to fend for himself on the streets of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. His parents had separated and neither of them wanted to take responsibility for a child with type 1 diabetes—a disease that is costly to treat and usually fatal for children in low-resource settings. “When I turned 16, I started to work. I looked for odd jobs so that I could earn money to pay for transportation to the doctor. But it was tough, so I tried to leave and go to Kenya. That didn’t work, so I tried to leave for Sudan. I wasn’t able to leave the country. But that’s OK. Those experiences got me here.” The “here” Estifanos refers to is the Ethiopian Diabetes Association, where Misrak Tarekegn serves as the Project Director. The Association provides treatment and education for Estifanos and over 200 other children with type 1 diabetes. As Misrak explains: “The fact that diabetes and other non-communicable diseases have not gotten the same prioritization [as HIV, TB, and malaria] will always be an obstacle for our work. So what we want to tell the government is, even if their numbers are only 10 or 5 percent, each life has value.” Estifanos has his own message for the government and for the world: “The government must get involved with this issue. Let them get involved. Let them say, ‘We are here,’ so that we can have hope. I really...I really...I really have to pass this message on.”

In the second phase of National Commission work, countries are investigating how to implement prioritised interventions through integrated delivery strategies. This work involves a baseline assessment of health system team structure, followed by recommendations for redesign of services to improve quality and access through optimal task distribution. Acting on these recommendations will require initial implementation at pilot training sites, followed by national scale-up with financial and technical support. As discussed in section 3 of this report, the cost of increasing coverage of these prioritised interventions exceeds available fiscal space in the poorest countries. Modest progress may still be possible in countries able to commit more domestic resources to health, but for many more there is an urgent need for global solidarity.
